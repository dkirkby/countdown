# countdown

A simple countdown timer webapp created as a test of LLM-assisted programming. Try it [here](dkirkby.github.io/countdown).

The initial version was created using ChatGPT o1-mini with the following prompt:

> Can you help me create a simple web app consisting of a HTML file, a CSS file and a javascript file. The app should minimize the use of external libraries and be mobile friendly and modern standards compliant. When the app page is first visited, the full window is equally divided into a few clickable areas, each labeled by a time in seconds. Clicking on any of these will start a countdown timer for the corresponding number of seconds, with the time remaining updated every second. When the timer expires, the area resets to its original state. The times to display are determined by a URL query parameter. For example use "&times=30,60,90" to specify three clickable areas for 30s, 60s and 90s. When running the app on a mobile device, it should run in full screen mode.

The resulting files are tagged as 1.0 and were fully functional. See a PDF transcript of the ChatGPT session [here](chatgpt-transcript.pdf).
